{"name":"MP-and-friends","tagline":"Who are your MP's commercial friends?","body":"## MP & Friends\r\n\r\nData on MPs and registered UK companies from [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/) has been combined to list the company directorships of every MP and the names of every co-director of those companies.\r\n\r\nThe data is presented as a 'Friends' graph linking each MP to their companies and the directors of those companies.\r\n\r\n#### Data issues\r\n\r\nSome peoples have not always included their 'other' names (e.g., any middle name) in the paperwork to Companies House, e.g., Diane Abbott and Diane Julie Abbott.  The list of co-directors is based on name and giving a different name means that the visual display may omit some links between people/companies.\r\n\r\nSearching the Companies House data, using a person's name, returns all people whose name contains both the first and last name, e.g., a search on David Cameron returns almost 1,200 entries, including ALASTAIR CAMERON DAVID.  Date of birth is used to identify a unique individual.  It is possible that two different company directors share the same date of birth and this App incorrectly treats them as the same person.\r\n\r\nCheck out [your MP's directorships](https://rawgit.com/Derek-Jones/MP-and-Friends/master/frontend/mp.html)\r\n\r\nTeam members:\r\n\r\n[Tom Paskhalis](https://github.com/tpaskhalis)\r\n\r\n[Sharechiwai](https://github.com/sharechiwai)\r\n\r\n[Daeus](https://github.com/daeus)\r\n\r\n[Derek Jones](http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
