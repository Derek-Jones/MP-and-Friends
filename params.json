{"name":"MP-and-friends","tagline":"Who are your MP's commercial friends?","body":"## MP & Friends\r\n\r\nData on MPs and registered UK companies from [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/) has been combined to list the company directorships of every MP and the names of every co-director of those companies.\r\n\r\nThe data is presented as a 'Friends' graph linking each MP to their companies and the directors of those companies.\r\n\r\n#### Data issues\r\n\r\nSome peoples have not always included their 'other' names (e.g., any middle name) in the paperwork to Companies House, e.g., Diane Abbott and Diane Julie Abbott.  The list of co-directors is based on name and giving a different name means that the visual display may omit some links between people/companies.\r\n\r\nSometimes an MP has included the suffix 'MP' to their name in the paperwork for one company, but not in the paperwork for another company.  An attempt has been made to normalise the data so that this used of 'MP' has not affected the results.\r\n\r\nSearching the Companies House data, using a person's name, returns all people whose name contains both the first and last name, e.g., a search on David Cameron returns almost 1,200 entries, including ALASTAIR CAMERON DAVID.  Date of birth is used to identify a unique individual.  It is possible that two different company directors share the same date of birth and if this occurs the MP-and-Friends App will incorrectly treat them as the same person.\r\n\r\nSome MPs are known by different names in different contexts.  For instance, [James Gerald Douglas Howarth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Howarth) is listed on the Parliamentary site as Gerald Howarth, but is listed in the Companies House data as James Howarth.  The Mp-and-Friends App uses first-name_last-name and so incorrect lists the directorships of the person discussed in this paragraph.\r\n\r\nCheck out [your MP's directorships](http://rawgit.com/Derek-Jones/MP-and-Friends/master/frontend/mp.html)\r\n\r\nTeam members:\r\n\r\n[Tom Paskhalis](https://github.com/tpaskhalis)\r\n\r\n[Sharechiwai](https://github.com/sharechiwai)\r\n\r\n[Daeus](https://github.com/daeus)\r\n\r\n[Derek Jones](http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
